    profile: Since 2016, I have worked as a language teacher focusing on bilingualism and cultural understanding. Previously I have worked as a project manager at Institute for Minority Education at University College South Denmark focusing on using teaching examples and methodology from the German/Danish border region in order to improve the teaching of bilingual children. I have a hands-on approach to counseling and communicate directly in a motivating way. Throughout my career, I have worked with intercultural- understanding and counseling. Moreover, I speak 6 languages and have lived and worked in five out of the seven continents and learned how to live in different cultures and build a new network. I have three children and live in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen.
